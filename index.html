<h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
    I would say that Pakistan has faced several challenges since its independence. But on the other hand, Pakistan is rich in culture and has a young population. This population can help Pakistan to become more economically stable and help Pakistan to prosper. This country had been faced several challenges, such as poverty, terrorism, and political instability, and done major improvements in many scenarios.
    Pakistan’s strength is its location and size; this country also benefits from foreign aid and receives donations from IMF, World Bank, and the USA, which means that Pakistan has some good international relations. The major weakness of Pakistan is that people lack knowledge in different fields to become a more modernized society. Pakistan also lacks an efficient education system.
    There is improper governance, a lack of an efficient education system, and health care problems that can lead to future difficulties for Pakistan. As Pakistan has faced many challenges in history, it can also face any other challenge with faith and strength.
